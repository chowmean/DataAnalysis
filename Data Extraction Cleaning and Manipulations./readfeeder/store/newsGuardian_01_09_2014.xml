      <title>How Isis came to be</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/22/syria-iraq-incubators-isis-jihad</link>
      <description>Three years ago, Islamic State did not exist  now it controls vast swaths of Syria and Iraq. How did we get here?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, the Islamic State (Isis) did not exist; now it controls vast swaths of Syria and Iraq. Showing off its handiwork daily via Twitter and YouTube, Isis has repeatedly demonstrated that it is much more than a transnational terrorist organisation  rather, it is an entity with sophisticated command, control, propaganda and logistical capabilities, and one that has proven its ability to take and hold strategically critical territory at the heart of the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as world leaders grapple with how to respond to this unprecedented crisis, they must first understand how Isis came to exist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/22/syria-iraq-incubators-isis-jihad"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Alibaba delivers benefits of a new digital economy to remotest China</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/25/china-taobao-ecommerce-alibaba-rural-china</link>
      <description>Villagers embrace e-commerce using Taobao, the online shopping subsidiary of Jack Mas internet group&lt;p&gt;We drive through the mist, down a long country road, to reach Peixie. At first sight this remote village seems to have little connection with the 21st-century economy. But step inside the company started by Hua Yongle, on the main street, and you will soon see why it is one of the 20 Taobao villages selected by internet e-commerce giant &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/alibaba" title=""&gt;Alibaba&lt;/a&gt;. The firm launched by Chinese entrepreneur &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/sep/11/news.newmedia" title=""&gt;Jack Ma&lt;/a&gt; (due to be floated soon on the New York stock exchange)  or more exactly its &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taobao" title=""&gt;Taobao subsidiary&lt;/a&gt;  has completely changed the face of Peixie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over a quick tea Hua, 32, explains how he started his business. Behind him two staff members respond by email to potential buyers, register orders and sort stacks of invoices. The hammer-and-sickle Communist party emblem hangs on the wall. He is a member, but sees nothing odd about devoting all his time to trade. Hua has been particularly successful in growing a retail business, which delivers all over China, selling locally manufactured bamboo mats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/25/china-taobao-ecommerce-alibaba-rural-china"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Orkney and Shetland islanders already winning Scotlands independence debate</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/20/scottish-independence-debate-orkney-shetland</link>
      <description>Scotlands oil and fish-rich northern isles have a powerful symbolic hold for Scots, giving them political leverage with both yes and no camps that belies their size&lt;p&gt;Orkneys farmers are a phlegmatic bunch. Sitting at the livestock auction in the town of Kirkwall, coolly assessing the bullocks and heifers, the men bid for the cattle with a quick flick of the fingers before offering blunt and unsentimental views on another bidding war: next months referendum for Scottish independence. Most were against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jim Skea, leaning against a dull grey metal railing, said: We just dont know enough about independence. Were better off together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/20/scottish-independence-debate-orkney-shetland"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/aug/26/guardian-weekly-helen-read-good-meet-you</link>
      <description>Flying around Australia in the service of Indigenous art, this reader appreciates the Weeklys coverage of culture&lt;p&gt;When I shove the handy-sized Guardian Weekly into a handbag, spare minutes become a treat of unwrinkling pages and having a good read. Flying in small planes across north-west Australia, or holding international exhibitions for the Aboriginal artists visited, I know the paper always keeps me in the world news loop. I love the book reviews, obituaries and &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/michaelbillington" title=""&gt;Michael Billington&lt;/a&gt;s theatre critiques, which catapult me to London, even if I am sitting on a fuel drum on some dusty airstrip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a passionate admirer of &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog" title=""&gt;Australias First Peoples art&lt;/a&gt;, in all its diversity, I believe the physical force, the visual content, is something we have yet to find the words to describe. With 120 different Indigenous languages still spoken  frequently as a first language  and local painting styles that educate, archive, artistically express, bring income, celebrate and are frequently masterpieces in themselves, this art movements journey on to the world stage is surprisingly slow, and yet showing, still, what painting can be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/aug/26/guardian-weekly-helen-read-good-meet-you"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Rekindling sparks of life in Frances abandoned ghost villages</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/01/france-abandoned-villages-regeneration-celles</link>
      <description>Amid picnics and parties, former residents and descendants have not lost all hope of returning to their ruined settlements&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, in a freshly mown hayfield on the Var highlands of south-eastern France, about 60 people held a picnic. It could have been a family reunion, but there was not much nostalgia in the air. When the former inhabitants of Brov&amp;egrave;s return to their land for their annual pilgrimage every spring, they mostly remember the pain of being expropriated by the army, 40 years earlier. However some of them still nurse the dream they might one day return for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/secondworldwar" title=""&gt;second world war&lt;/a&gt; the army was looking for a large area of land upon which to build a camp. In the early 1960s it settled on the Canjuers plateau, about half an hours drive from Draguignan, in southeastern France. Brov&amp;egrave;s, a village going back to the 15th century, was inside the projected perimeter. It was home to just under 100 people in the winter and more in the summer, when former residents came back for holidays. In the spring of 1974, the remaining diehards finally had to go. Even the graves had been dug up and the remains displaced. Access to the empty village was forbidden.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/01/france-abandoned-villages-regeneration-celles"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Why the calls of the wild may be more complex than zoologists first thought</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/aug/30/animal-sounds-human-speech-language</link>
      <description>Mathematical models offer new insights into animal vocal sequences, but evolution of language remains a mystery&lt;p&gt;From ultrasonic bat chirps to eerie whale songs, the animal kingdom is a noisy place. While some sounds might have meaning  typically something like Im a male, arent I great?  no other creatures have a true language except for us. Or do they?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1792/20141370.abstract" title=""&gt;A new study&lt;/a&gt; on animal calls has found that the patterns of barks, whistles and clicks from seven different species appear to be more complex than previously thought. The researchers used mathematical tests to see how well the sequences of sounds fit to models ranging in complexity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/aug/30/animal-sounds-human-speech-language"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>How Isis came to be; Chinese villages with that Alibaba boost; water as a source of comfort&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, nobody had heard of it. Now the militant group Islamic State controls stretches of Iraq and Syria, building on its mission to establish a caliphate. The front page of this edition attempts to explain where these jihadis came from and how they have secured such a substantial foothold, so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capturing and distilling events in the Middle East is never easy. So in addition to our cover story, we bring you several pages inside. We review the week in which the rhetoric from the US ramped up significantly as Barack Obama called &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/isis" title=""&gt;Islamic State&lt;/a&gt; a cancer after the beheading of American journalist &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/25/james-foley-family-letter" title=""&gt;James Foley&lt;/a&gt;. Pentagon officials were equally outraged, and urged action against what they called an apocalyptic organisation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/aug/26/inside-guardian-weekly-abby-deveney"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

It alerts you to decay, dental abscesses, periodontitis, gingivitis and other horrors that may attack your teeth and gums.

      <description>Proliferation of arms; inequality is the problem; neoliberalism is a con&lt;p&gt;How could anyone suggest, as Timothy Garton Ash does, that only by working with the US can the problems of the Middle East be solved &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/01/first-world-war-still-played-out-ukraine-syria-legacy-1914" title=""&gt;(8 August)&lt;/a&gt;? The US is mainly the cause of the problems; everywhere it interferes, it leaves bedlam behind. Iraq was livable before the invasion; now there is chaos. Of course, the US administration may have had good intentions but the American companies that it employs  Halliburton, Blackwater, KBR  are only in there for the money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/aug/26/guardian-weekly-letters-weapons-trade"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Letter from the US: new New York</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/26/letter-from-new-york-changing-brooklyn</link>
      <description>A trip to one of the citys new gastronomic attractions stimulates an appetite for the history of the Brooklyn riverfront&lt;p&gt;Its 11am at the ferry terminal and the clamour to get out of a clammy Manhattan has begun. The air around the city is clogged by yellow cab exhaust fumes and humidity generated by a weeks worth of toil. In the city that never sleeps, New Yorkers, it seems, rarely stop. The weekend provides an opportunity to take a breath, and this July Saturday presents the chance for an intake of fresh air. The two orderly queues are for the East river ferry to either Brooklyn or New Jersey, depending on which line you find yourself in. For a brief moment I find myself among the families heading out to the Jersey shore and am lost in a maelstrom of coolers, windbreakers and beach towels. Only a brief but friendly reply of No sir, this boats heading to Jersey prevents me from boarding the wrong ferry. A few minutes later and Im heading for the banks of Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Id been given a tip to visit &lt;a href="http://www.smorgasburg.com/" title=""&gt;Smorgasburg&lt;/a&gt;, which describes itself as a Brooklyn flea food market. Named on account of it being based in the Williamsburg area, Smorgasburg is a food festival where local shops, restaurants and individual traders hire stalls to show off their gastronomic dexterity. A relaxed crowd of wannabe foodies and twentysomething trendies meander through the market underneath a blanket of mouthwatering smells produced over a background track of chopping, frying, boiling and chewing. I opt for a sample of Japanese-inspired tacos, Filipino-style spring rolls, speciality sausages, Caribbean patties, a modern schnitzel and an old-fashioned doughnut  all washed down with traditional lemonade.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/26/letter-from-new-york-changing-brooklyn"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Lizzie Armitstead seals World Cup title; All Blacks win big to retain Bledisloe Cup; Hunter Mahan wins first FedExCup play-off&lt;p&gt;West Yorkshire rugby league fans clad in big-game animal-themed sportswear descended on Wembley as Leeds Rhinos and Castleford Tigers slugged it out in the Challenge Cup final. The Rhinos &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/aug/24/leeds-castleford-challenge-cup-final-match-report" title=""&gt;took local bragging rights after a 23-10 victory&lt;/a&gt;, a first cup success for 15 years that ended a losing streak of six straight final defeats. That made it all the more satisfying for a clutch of veteran Leeds players nearing the ends of their careers, including the captain, Kevin Sinfield. This was a reward for perseverance  not just of the players but the coaching staff and the fans, Sinfield said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/aug/26/weekly-sport-diary-leeds-rhinos"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Richard Attenborough's death: a sad day for the British film industry</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/24/richard-attenborough-death-sad-british-film-industry</link>
      <description>'Dickie' was an actor, producer, director, world-class networker, an establishment heavyweight and incorrigible wearer of the Garrick Club salmon-and-pink tie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/live/2014/aug/25/richard-attenborough-dies-at-90-the-world-reacts" title=""&gt;Richard Attenborough dies  tributes paid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/24/richard-attenborough-died-aged-90" title=""&gt;Richard Attenborough dies aged 90&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;How he hated being called &amp;quot;Dickie&amp;quot;. It sounded like the name of a luvvie lightweight  and Richard Attenborough, the brilliant stage and screen star, and director of the multi Oscar-winning Gandhi, was anything but that. He was always a beaming, cherubic, endlessly charming, endlessly garrulous man: actor, producer, director, world-class networker and committee man, an establishment heavyweight and incorrigible wearer of the Garrick Club salmon-and-pink tie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attenborough started out the quintessential character actor: he was the baby-faced, sinister Pinkie in Brighton Rock in 1947, before that, a scared young naval rating in In Which We Serve in 1942. Later, he would morph into the stiff-upper-lipped Squadron Leader Bartlett in The Great Escape in 1963, and, chillingly, returned to villainy as the thin-lipped Reginald Christie in 10 Rillington Place in 1971. Yet he was finally to evolve into the apparently benign old visionary in Spielberg's Jurassic Park (1993) and the lovable teddy-bearish Santa Claus in Miracle on 34th Street (1994).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/24/richard-attenborough-death-sad-british-film-industry"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Fingerprint scanning to be used to fight food shortages made worse by hoarding and smuggling to neighbouring countries&lt;p&gt;Venezuela's president, Nicol&amp;aacute;s Maduro, plans to introduce a compulsory &amp;quot;biometric card&amp;quot; designed to limit individuals' food purchases using a fingerprint scanner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move, announced on Wednesday, is part of the government's latest effort to fight the oil-rich nation's chronic food shortages, which it claims result from hoarding by speculators, who resell goods at a profit, and from smuggling into neighbouring countries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/21/biometric-venezuela-food-shortages-smuggling-fingerprints"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Argentina in latest debt default crisis pits 'motherland' against 'vultures'</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/20/argentina-kirchner-debts-crisis-bond-holders-economics</link>
      <description>President Kirchner is bearing down on a US ruling that benefits just a few bond-holders, but critics say her economic policies are anyway 'leading nowhere'&lt;p&gt;Happy hour is now in full swing at The Temple Bar, a busy British-style pub in the upscale Palermo Soho district of Buenos Aires. Over a pint of artisan pale ale, a young economist, Martin Trombetta, admits it is hard to tell from where we are sitting that his country is now in default again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many observers it is difficult to be sure whether this is even the case. Argentina's president, Cristina Fern&amp;aacute;ndez de Kirchner, continues to insist that the country has not recently defaulted on its sovereign debt for the second time in 13 years, while her chief finance minister, Axel Kicillof, accuses all those who think otherwise of dealing in &amp;quot;atomic nonsense&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/20/argentina-kirchner-debts-crisis-bond-holders-economics"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Welcome to Nap Club, the home of more focused, efficient workers | Stuart Heritage</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/19/nap-club-home-focused-efficient-workers</link>
      <description>Nappers aren't idle. But they are happier, healthier and more productive. Take it from an expert ...&lt;p&gt;Napping has an image problem. Tell a stranger that you take regular naps and they'll either start treating you contemptuously, as if you're so repulsively lily-livered that you can't get through a day without having to place your precious little head on a silken pillow of stardust and unicorn fluff; or they'll just get jealous and bash you on the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Napping? In the daytime? When you're supposed to be working? It just sounds a bit namby-pamby, doesn't it? A bit comfort-blanket. There seems to be a widespread belief that introducing napping in the workplace would be the start of a slippery slope of infantilisation that's doomed to end with everyone wearing pastel-coloured rompersuits and slapping their porridgey hands against their dad's iPad instead of working out the north-east division's Q3 projections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/19/nap-club-home-focused-efficient-workers"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
