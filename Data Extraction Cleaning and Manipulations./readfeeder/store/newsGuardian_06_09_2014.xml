      <title>Inside Putinworld, where few risk speaking truth to power</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/29/putin-world-kremlin-moscow-power-circle</link>
      <description>Kremlinology is back in vogue, the inner circle contracts and ruthless competition is encouraged among underlings&lt;p&gt;Revered, even feared, to the point where no one will contradict him; aloof, isolated, a digital hermit who is never out of touch; broadly supported, but very narrowly advised by an ever-tighter group of confidantes. This is the picture of Vladimir Putin and his leadership style painted by a number of people with knowledge of the inner workings of the Kremlin, at a time when such things matter more than at any time since the collapse of communism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putin's Ukraine actions this year have turned him once again into arguably the world's most fascinating leader. But just as Kremlinology comes back into vogue, the walls of Putin's central Moscow redoubt are becoming as opaque as they were during the time of Brezhnev.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/29/putin-world-kremlin-moscow-power-circle"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>US ban on Russian-made AK-47s sets off a rifle-buying frenzy</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/02/sanctions-moscow-ak47-buying-frenzy</link>
      <description>Demand for the assault weapon has risen sharply since US imports were halted as part of sanctions against Moscow&lt;p&gt;Thirty-six hours after the Obama administration banned importation of the classic brand of assault rifles as part of &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/28/obama-ukraine-russia-more-sanctions-invasion" title=""&gt;sanctions against Russia&lt;/a&gt;, a Maryland dealer specialising in the weapon took stock of its inventory. There was nothing left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labouring almost nonstop, workers at Atlantic Firearms in the state of Maryland had shipped hundreds of Russian-made AK-47s  a rifle prized by consumers and despots  as buyers wiped out gun dealers inventories around the country. The frenzy was brought on, in part, by a suspicion among some &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/07/17/how-americas-new-sanctions-on-russia-affect-american-gun-owners/" title=""&gt;gun owners&lt;/a&gt; that the Russia-Ukraine conflict was a back-door excuse to ban guns many Democrats dont like. Some customers bought eight to 10 rifles for nearly $1,000 each or more, stockpiling them as investments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/02/sanctions-moscow-ak47-buying-frenzy"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Streets clogged as people return to wrecked homes, with official review of needs to take up to six weeks&lt;p&gt;Gaza began the long process of picking up the pieces of shattered lives and homes on Wednesday after 50 days of bloodshed and destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The streets of Gaza City were clogged with tuk-tuks and donkey-drawn carts, many laden with women, children and pitiful possessions, heading towards homes which in thousands of cases have been reduced to rubble and twisted metal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/27/gaza-begins-pick-up-pieces-after-war"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Inside the 5 September edition</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/sep/02/inside-guardian-weekly-graham-snowdon</link>
      <description>A tour of Putinworld; Gaza picks up the pieces; what makes a city great&lt;p&gt;A kopeck for the thoughts of Vladimir Putin? The inscrutable (some would say downright disingenuous) Russian president has driven western leaders, diplomats and foreign-policy analysts to despair as they try to piece together his ambitions in Ukraine. The problem is, few people in Putins own government seem to know much about whats going on either. As EU and Nato chiefs hold crisis meetings to ponder their latest responses to Russias troop activities in eastern Ukraine, our fascinating cover story by &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/shaun-walker" title=""&gt;Shaun Walker&lt;/a&gt; takes us behind the scenes of Putins power base, where the Russian leaders authority is unchallenged and where policies are increasingly determined by an elite circle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European council appointed a new president this week  Polands Donald Tusk  though the mood in Brussels was subdued as national leaders contemplated more sanctions against Putin and also gloomy economic growth forecasts for the continent. The Guardians Brussels correspondent &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/iantraynor" title=""&gt;Ian Traynor&lt;/a&gt; surveys the lie of the land.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/sep/02/inside-guardian-weekly-graham-snowdon"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Good to meet you ... Parrill Stribling</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/sep/02/good-to-meet-you-parrill-stribling</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From New Mexico to New Zealand, this reader awaits the Weekly with great excitement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Eastern New Mexico University library offered The Guardian in 1969. It was thrilling to know what was going on in the world. There were articles about demonstrations in Paris and Germany. Their slant was totally different to what I was reading in New Mexico at the end of the 60s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I rediscovered the GW in Fez, Morocco, where I served as a US Peace Corps volunteer teaching English. There was a small kiosk near the French market that sold it. If I didnt have enough money, nobody minded me standing there reading. The GW kept me informed on what was happening from an international perspective. I read about the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_March"&gt;Green March&lt;/a&gt; to the Sahara and saw it happening around me when the police rounded up the unemployed, homeless and sex workers and shipped them south to La&amp;acirc;youne.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/sep/02/good-to-meet-you-parrill-stribling"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Hollywood vs the novel: how film can bring new life to a well-loved story</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/05/authors-books-film-adaptations-cinema</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When books are made into films the rewards can be lucrative, though the writer must let go&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moviegoers are swimming in a sea of book adaptations, as movie studios continue their frantic search for the perfect pre-sold properties to gobble up, completely reconfigure and then spit out, in the hopes that fans of the original will flock to the multiplex like millions of dutiful pop-cultural drones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of movies this year will have started their lives as books, many of them of the young adult genre that is enjoying a heyday  if not always a payday  in Hollywood. &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2014/aug/27/if-i-stay-gayle-forman-in-pictures"&gt;If I Stay&lt;/a&gt;, Gayle Formans novel about a teenage cello player who, while in a coma, must decide whether to live or die, came to the big screen in a film starring Chlo&amp;euml; Grace Moretz in the US earlier this summer. Its a fitting, three-hankie bookend to one of the years most satisfying young adult hits, the teen-cancer drama &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/19/fault-in-our-stars-review-john-green"&gt;The Fault In Our Stars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/05/authors-books-film-adaptations-cinema"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Wild teenage behaviour linked to rapid cognitive change in the brain</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/sep/05/teenage-brain-behaviour-prefrontal-cortex</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scientific studies suggest that differences in the prefrontal cortex could account for the impulsive actions of young people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teenagers can do the craziest things. They drive at high speeds. They stand around outside loud parties and smoke weed in front of the cops. They guzzle liquor. They insult their parents  or lie to them  and feel no remorse, because, of course, their parents are idiots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is easy to blame peer pressure or wilfulness, but scientific studies suggest that at least some of this out-there behaviour has a physiological tie-in: brain mapping technologies show that the average teenagers brain looks slightly different from an adults. The biggest differences lie in the prefrontal cortex  a part of the brain associated with reasoning  and in the networks of brain cells that link the cortex to regions of the brain that are less about reasoning and thinking and more about emotion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/sep/05/teenage-brain-behaviour-prefrontal-cortex"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Americas great divide; foreign policy gridlock; the instruments of suffering&lt;p&gt;Americas racial rift was created by two-and-a-half centuries of brutal, unapologetic slavery  embedded, meanwhile, in the countrys constitution  followed by a century of keeping now free African Americans down and in their place &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/16/ferguson-michael-brown-unrest-reality-segregated-society"&gt;(22 August)&lt;/a&gt;. Then, 350 years after the first African slaves were brought to Virginia, the civil rights and racial equality of African Americans were finally acknowledged in law.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/sep/02/weekly-letters-america-great-divide"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Louis van Gaal hopes to solve Uniteds problems with Ángel di María</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/02/weekly-sport-diary-united-di-maria</link>
      <description>Zimbabwes three-wicket win stuns Australia; Rosberg and Hamilton make peace; Sharapova knocked out of US Open&lt;p&gt;Premier League football, the competition that makes global banking look like a model of economic prudence. Manchester United took their summer spending beyond an eye-popping $260m, including a British transfer record of &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/25/manchester-united-angel-di-maria-transfer-real-madrid" title=""&gt;around $100m on Real Madrid midfielder &amp;Aacute;ngel di Mar&amp;iacute;a&lt;/a&gt;. Colombian striker Radamael Falcao &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/01/radamel-falcao-manchester-united-season-long-loan-monaco" title=""&gt;joined United on loan from Monaco&lt;/a&gt; for a $10m fee, while Ajaxs &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/30/manchester-united-daley-blind-ajax-louis-van-gaal" title=""&gt;Daley Blind&lt;/a&gt; was also due to join Louis van Gaals Old Trafford revolution, which has so far yielded just two points from three games. Chelsea, meanwhile, gave away their &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/29/chelsea-fernando-torres-milan-jose-mourinho" title=""&gt;former $80m record signing, Fernando Torres, to Milan for free&lt;/a&gt;, after three underwhelming seasons at Stamford Bridge. I cannot wait to start this new adventure, said Torres, clearly struggling to contain his relief.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/02/weekly-sport-diary-united-di-maria"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Letter from Cuba: fight club</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/02/weekly-letter-cuba-boxing-champions</link>
      <description>Havanas old-school boxing gyms offer a glimpse into Cubas soul as well as a path to recognition for their young pugilists&lt;p&gt;I was in a gym in Havana not because of a desire for violent exercise but thanks to a travel book about boxing in Cuba. Here, two sports inspire national fervour. One is baseball, and the other is boxing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sports are totally amateur, because professional sport was banned by Fidel Castro after the revolution. The only way to make your fortune as a player or a fighter is to defect. Few do. Its part of the Cuban enigma that some things are more important than hard cash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/02/weekly-letter-cuba-boxing-champions"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Emilie Brzezinski: the American artist carving a niche with a chainsaw</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/sep/02/emilie-brzezinski-wood-sculptor-chainsaw</link>
      <description>Wood sculptor from a renowned US political dynasty brings a distinct power dimension to her oversized artworks&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.emiliebrzezinski.com/?page_id=50" title=""&gt;Emilie Brzezinski&lt;/a&gt; knows more than most political wives about power tools. She owns six chainsaws. All made by Stihl. And all designed for different jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 360, its for big things, she explains, pulling out a machine that looks as if it could give the entire forest in nearby Great Falls Park a buzz cut. The chain (its a rip chain, she explains, to make the cutting faster) runs around a guide bar thats three-quarters of a metre long.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/sep/02/emilie-brzezinski-wood-sculptor-chainsaw"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Rekindling sparks of life in Frances abandoned ghost villages</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/01/france-abandoned-villages-regeneration-celles</link>
      <description>Amid picnics and parties, former residents and descendants have not lost all hope of returning to their ruined settlements&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, in a freshly mown hayfield on the Var highlands of south-eastern France, about 60 people held a picnic. It could have been a family reunion, but there was not much nostalgia in the air. When the former inhabitants of Brov&amp;egrave;s return to their land for their annual pilgrimage every spring, they mostly remember the pain of being expropriated by the army, 40 years earlier. However some of them still nurse the dream they might one day return for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/secondworldwar" title=""&gt;second world war&lt;/a&gt; the army was looking for a large area of land upon which to build a camp. In the early 1960s it settled on the Canjuers plateau, about half an hours drive from Draguignan, in southeastern France. Brov&amp;egrave;s, a village going back to the 15th century, was inside the projected perimeter. It was home to just under 100 people in the winter and more in the summer, when former residents came back for holidays. In the spring of 1974, the remaining diehards finally had to go. Even the graves had been dug up and the remains displaced. Access to the empty village was forbidden.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/01/france-abandoned-villages-regeneration-celles"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>US airstrikes and British, French and Australian aid assist the advances against Isis&lt;p&gt;US airstrikes near a Shia Turkoman town north of Baghdad have cleared the way for militiamen and Iraqi troops to rescue 12,000 residents from jihadis who had besieged them for more than two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jihadis from the extremist group Islamic State (Isis) had partially withdrawn from the outskirts of Amerli, around 110 miles north of Baghdad, when paramilitaries and Iraqi forces attacked around dawn on Sunday. The attack came hours after US jets had pushed further south into Iraq than at any time in the last three weeks when they have been attacking insurgent positions in support of the Kurds. Aid was also air dropped to Amerli by British, French and Australian aircraft.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/31/isis-islamic-state-iraq-advances"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Sheikh Sadik al-Ghariani may be sacked as grand mufti after Libyan parliament, which appointed him, was forced to flee its capital&lt;p&gt;Libya's most senior religious authority, the grand mufti Sheikh Sadik al-Ghariani, is believed to have fled Britain after it emerged that he was helping to direct the Islamist takeover of Tripoli from the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghariani left the UK for Qatar as Home Office officials began examining broadcasts he had made to Islamist groups using an internet television station owned by a relative in Devon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/31/libya-spiritual-leader-leaves-uk-islamist-tripoli-exeter"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/31/tripoli-residents-libya-dawn-islamist-militias</link>
      <description>Locals say their homes could be robbed if they leave, and if they stay they risk being rounded up by Islamist militias&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every night is a night of fear in the house of the date palms, a luxurious villa in the western suburbs of Tripoli. Its occupants are among thousands of city residents scared of being arrested by Islamist militias of Libya Dawn, which last week took over the Libyan capital and are targeting those from opposing tribes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/31/tripoli-residents-libya-dawn-islamist-militias"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Campaigners say city is entering 'era of civil disobedience' after China claims  free leadership poll would lead to 'chaotic society'&lt;p&gt;Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong have vowed to take over the city's financial heart in a &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/06/occupy-central-hong-kong-democracy-campaign" title=""&gt;civil disobedience campaign&lt;/a&gt;, after China ruled out allowing its residents to freely choose their next leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beijing has long promised that the chief executive of the region would be elected by universal suffrage from 2017, prompting Occupy Central and pan-democrat lawmakers to battle for substantial electoral reforms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/31/hong-kong-activists-open-elections-ruled-out-beijing"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Russia and economic warfare: RIP the free market new world order | Larry Elliott</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/31/russia-economic-warfare-rip-free-market-new-world-order</link>
      <description>Russia faces damaging economic sanctions, but this also brings down the final curtain on capitalism's apparent victory in 1989&lt;p&gt;It is a quarter of a century since the Berlin Wall came down. The cold war was eventually won by superior western economic power and a new era began once the communist regime collapsed in the Soviet Union and the two halves of Germany were reunited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time in 25 years, the west is seriously worried about Russia. Ukraine's president, Petro Poroshenko, said at the weekend his country was &amp;quot;close to a point of no return  full-scale war&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/31/russia-economic-warfare-rip-free-market-new-world-order"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Why the calls of the wild may be more complex than zoologists first thought</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/aug/30/animal-sounds-human-speech-language</link>
      <description>Mathematical models offer new insights into animal vocal sequences, but evolution of language remains a mystery&lt;p&gt;From ultrasonic bat chirps to eerie whale songs, the animal kingdom is a noisy place. While some sounds might have meaning  typically something like Im a male, arent I great?  no other creatures have a true language except for us. Or do they?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1792/20141370.abstract" title=""&gt;A new study&lt;/a&gt; on animal calls has found that the patterns of barks, whistles and clicks from seven different species appear to be more complex than previously thought. The researchers used mathematical tests to see how well the sequences of sounds fit to models ranging in complexity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/aug/30/animal-sounds-human-speech-language"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>This brutal blame game pays little heed to justice in Rotherham</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/aug/29/saturday-sketch-rotherham-edl</link>
      <description>Everyone in Rotherham has a view on the abuse scandal, especially the English Defence League&lt;p&gt;Rotherham has the unmistakable look of a depressed English town: a Bright Box, a Gregg's every 50ft, every second shop a charity shop. The last time the photographer was here, it was to do a story on the end of the high street. The last time I was here, it was to meet a man who'd had his life ruined by the Jeremy Kyle show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, possibly because it was almost the last shopping day before school starts again, it did not have the feel of a depressed town. The centre was full, people stopped to talk; when they design civic spaces in architectural models, these are the citizens they have in mind, leisurely enough to appreciate a bench, not so aimless as to go to sleep on it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/aug/29/saturday-sketch-rotherham-edl"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>How Isis came to be; Chinese villages with that Alibaba boost; water as a source of comfort&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, nobody had heard of it. Now the militant group Islamic State controls stretches of Iraq and Syria, building on its mission to establish a caliphate. The front page of this edition attempts to explain where these jihadis came from and how they have secured such a substantial foothold, so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capturing and distilling events in the Middle East is never easy. So in addition to our cover story, we bring you several pages inside. We review the week in which the rhetoric from the US ramped up significantly as Barack Obama called &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/isis" title=""&gt;Islamic State&lt;/a&gt; a cancer after the beheading of American journalist &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/25/james-foley-family-letter" title=""&gt;James Foley&lt;/a&gt;. Pentagon officials were equally outraged, and urged action against what they called an apocalyptic organisation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/aug/26/inside-guardian-weekly-abby-deveney"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
