      <title>Ban Ki-moon: 'World living in an era of unprecedented level of crises'</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/21/ban-ki-moon-world-living-era-undprecedented-level-crises</link>
      <description>UN secretary general prepares to welcome more than 140 heads of state to organisation's general assembly this week&lt;p&gt;More than 140 heads of state and government fly in to New York this week for the United Nations general assembly amid apprehension that international order is unraveling at an accelerating pace, while the world's leaders seem ever less willing or able to deal with the proliferating threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UN's humanitarian agencies are in danger of being completely overwhelmed by the multiple crises. Ebola is spreading rapidly across West Africa, swamping rickety national health systems and a thus-far underfunded UN effort to stop its advance. The spread of Islamic State (Isis) extremists in the Middle East, feeding on the destruction of the Syrian civil war and exposing the weakness of the Iraqi state, has similarly outpaced patchy international efforts at containment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/21/ban-ki-moon-world-living-era-undprecedented-level-crises"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Iraqi town where former foes are combining to fight Islamic State</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/23/iraq-isis-sunni-conflict-militants</link>
      <description>Sunnis uniting with Shias in Thuluyah as tribal leaders point to example of how war against Isis Islamic militants can be won&lt;p&gt;The metal-hulled boats carry out the wounded for treatment, as well as fruit to sell at market. They bring in supplies of cooking gas, medicine and ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cocooned in a bend in the Tigris river, this town shaded by orange trees and date palm groves has long relied on the waterway. But since Islamic State (Isis) militants blew up the last bridge into Thuluyah earlier this month, the river is the only way in or out  complicating efforts to resupply and reinforce beleaguered fighters here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/23/iraq-isis-sunni-conflict-militants"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Germanys Eurosceptics broaden their appeal and win regional votes</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/23/alternative-germany-eurosceptic-votes-afd</link>
      <description>The right-wing Alternative for Germany party has built on its support to make gains in Saxony, Brandenburg and Thuringia&lt;p&gt;The rise of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_for_Germany" title=""&gt;Alternative for Germany (AfD) party&lt;/a&gt; continued with it receiving 10.6% of the vote in Thuringia and 12.2% in Brandenburg on 14 September. Two weeks earlier it secured its first regional government seats in Saxony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new conservative party is beginning to gain ground. The AfD was founded 18 months ago, by former &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Democratic_Union_(Germany)" title=""&gt;Christian Democratic Union&lt;/a&gt; militants and sympathisers disappointed by Chancellor Angela Merkels shift towards the centre.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/23/alternative-germany-eurosceptic-votes-afd"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>After the Scottish referendum; UN surveys the wreckage; the history of emoticons&lt;p&gt;So, it was a No. Scotland may have voted to stay in the United Kingdom last week but the 45% of Scots who endorsed independence are still likely to have laid the foundations for extensive power devolution in the UK. With a sudden revival of popular interest in how the nation is governed, it feels like the British political system is under the microscope like never before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this weeks GW we bring you a special package on the aftermath of the independence referendum, as writers including Scottish author &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/irvine-welsh" title=""&gt;Irvine Welsh&lt;/a&gt; and regular columnists &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathanfreedland" title=""&gt;Jonathan Freedland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/timothygartonash" title=""&gt;Timothy Garton Ash&lt;/a&gt; pick over the future of the union and the roadmap to a more inclusive and relevant system of representation. I promise that you wont find sharper, more passionate and more insightful writing on the subject anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/sep/23/guardian-weekly-graham-snowdon"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Good to meet you ... Keith Openshaw</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/sep/23/guardian-weekly-meet-keith-openshaw</link>
      <description>This reader from a Manchester Guardian family travelled the world with the Weekly in hot pursuit&lt;p&gt;I was born into a Guardian family. In the 1930s my mother was a cook in the Manchester Guardian canteen in Cross Street. She occasionally returned to see former friends and often talked about the reporters she knew as well as CP Scott. Her youngest sister retired from the subscription department in 1978 after 43 years of service. My cousin helped print the Manchester Guardian for a similar number of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1968 I started subscribing to the Weekly when I moved overseas, first to Tanzania and then to Thailand. In September 1975, I returned to Tanzania for a five-year university teaching assignment. I then moved across the border to Kenya for seven years, first with a Kenyan energy project and later with an USAid regional renewable energy project for eastern and southern Africa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/sep/23/guardian-weekly-meet-keith-openshaw"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Guardian Weekly letters, 26 September 2014</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/sep/23/guardian-weekly-letters-26-september</link>
      <description>A world without debt; the funding of politics; Queen and country&lt;p&gt;In his article Europes economic nightmare approaches (&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/07/deflation-secular-stagnation-europe-economic-nightmare" title=""&gt;12&amp;nbsp;September&lt;/a&gt;), Paul Mason bases his analysis on the theory that over-indebtedness leads to deflation. However, the very term over-indebtedness makes no sense in 2014 where, as finally made explicit by the Bank of England in the article Money creation in the modern economy (in their 2014 Q1 Quarterly Bulletin), the vast majority of all money is created as debt by commercial banks making loans. In short, if the economy grows, that means more debt has been created. Reduce the amount of debt, and by definition theres less money in the economy. Pay off all debt, and the economy will be left with no money in it. In this scenario, how much debt is too much debt?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/sep/23/guardian-weekly-letters-26-september"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Relative isolation is no barrier to community in the small towns of rural Queensland&lt;p&gt;Its 6am on a winters morning: mist is rising off the lake, and the kookaburras laugh in a nearby gum, challenging the laggards to get up and enjoy yet another sunny day in the low-to-mid-20s. Thats 20C, not your Pommy 20 Fahrenheit  it never gets that cold here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We turn over in bed. No need for us oldies to get up just yet, though our friendly juvenile whip-bird has now joined the morning chorus, lulling us back to sleep.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/23/boreen-point-australia-retirement-nature"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Five-star Leicester City bypass Manchester Uniteds glittering attack</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/23/weekly-sports-diary-manchester-united-defeat</link>
      <description>Lewis Hamilton wins Singapore Grand Prix; Durham crowned one-day champions at Lords; Ana Ivanovic clinches Pan Pacific Open&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/02/weekly-sport-diary-united-di-maria" title=""&gt;$260m of new attacking talent&lt;/a&gt; at their disposal, it was no surprise that Manchester United scored three goals at Premier League new boys Leicester City. What was less foreseeable was that they would &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/21/leicester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report" title=""&gt;concede five&lt;/a&gt;, much to the irritation of their increasingly red-faced coach Louis van Gaal. You cannot win a game any more when you do that, he said, a judgment that was hard to find fault with. At the Etihad stadium, Frank Lampard popped up with a late equaliser for Manchester City against former club Chelsea as two of this seasons likely title challengers cancelled each other out. In Spain there were big wins for the big two, Barcelona &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2014/sep/21/levante-v-barcelona-la-liga-live" title=""&gt;thrashing Levante 5-0&lt;/a&gt; and Real Madrid making that effort look restrained with an &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/20/deportivo-la-coruna-real-madrid-la-liga-match-report" title=""&gt;8-2 dismantling of Deportivo La Coru&amp;ntilde;a&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/23/weekly-sports-diary-manchester-united-defeat"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Radio-tagging sheep will spell the death of the old ways, say French farmers</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/22/french-farmers-sheep-radio-tagging</link>
      <description>Farmers question effectiveness of scheme against outbreaks of disease and fear it risks industrialising traditional methods&lt;p&gt;When it comes to protest, French farmers are hardly known for their reticence. Nothing draws them out into the streets  or, as recently, &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/10729606/Sheep-storm-Paris-Louvre-in-farmers-protest.html" title=""&gt;its art galleries&lt;/a&gt;  quite like a good European Union agricultural policy dispute. But a demonstration held in May by around 50 sheep farmers outside the &lt;em&gt;Tribunal Administratif &lt;/em&gt;(which hears civil disputes) in Grenoble, in the south-east, hinged on a relatively new EU gripe: the rules around microchipping livestock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Etienne Mabille and Ir&amp;egrave;ne Bordel, both in their 50s and well tanned by years on the mountain pasture, raise 57 ewes organically at M&amp;eacute;vouillon, in nearby Dr&amp;ocirc;me. In April 2012 their farm was inspected. All their animals were tagged and the stock book was up to date. But the couple refused to duplicate the identification system with a second tag containing a computer chip. The inspectors reported this as an anomaly. The following August the regional authorities told them they would no longer qualify for EU subsidies and must pay a heavy fine. This was a severe blow for the small farm so they went to court. The farmers won the first round, but the case is still open.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/22/french-farmers-sheep-radio-tagging"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Former president says he wants to get his 'political family back to work' after announcing he will return to frontline politics&lt;p&gt;The former French president Nicolas Sarkozy was given a prime-time television news slot to explain his plans after announcing his return to frontline politics. Sarkozy set out his platform for the race to head the opposition UMP party, which will hold a hotly contested leadership vote in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Sarkozy: The Return Part II, he was given 45 minutes to reintroduce himself to the French public.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/21/nicolas-sarkozy-france-political-comeback"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Reformist Ashraf Ghani will become president, while his rival Abdullah Abdullah will be able to fill new role of chief executive&lt;p&gt;Ashraf Ghani, a former World Bank economist, has been officially declared the new president of Afghanistan, after three months of political deadlock was resolved through a new, untested power-sharing arrangement with his arch rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghani signed the agreement with Abdullah Abdullah, his adversary in presidential elections in June that left the country suspended in acrimony, fraud allegations and political paralysis. Under the deal, Ghani will run the cabinet and be in charge of strategic functions, while Abdullah will be able to appoint a &amp;quot;chief executive&amp;quot; who will be in charge of daily duties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/21/afghanistan-power-sharing-deal-ghani-abdullah"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Militants assassinate rights workers and army officers while mystery jets launch raids on Tripoli&lt;p&gt;Two popular young peace activists were among ten prominent Libyan civil rights workers and senior army officers assassinated in the eastern city of Benghazi on Friday, a day that has swiftly become known as Black Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coordinated killings, a vivid demonstration of the power of militants, took place at a time when the country is in chaos: an Islamist-led coalition is holding Tripoli and the UN has reported that 250,000 have fled the&amp;nbsp;fighting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/20/teenaged-libyan-peace-activists-assassinations-benghazi-libya-tripoli"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>John Key wins third term, as alliance between Kim Dotcom and the Maori Mana Movement fails to win a single seat&lt;p&gt;In the 32 months since the ostentatious FBI-backed raid on Kim Dotcom's opulent home north of Auckland, the German &amp;eacute;migr&amp;eacute; has become an integral, irrepressible and unavoidable force in New Zealand politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Undaunted by US attempts to extradite him to face charges stemming from alleged copyright breaches by his Megaupload website, Dotcom mounted a vigorous counterattack, both in the courts and the public square, ultimately leading to the resignation of two ministers of the crown and a seething feud with the prime minister, John Key.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/20/new-zealand-election-john-key-kim-dotcom-landslide"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Catalan leader denies Scotland's referendum result is a setback as Spain's PM says vote planned for November will be illegal&lt;p&gt;The Catalan parliament passed a law paving the way for a non-binding vote on secession on Friday, hours after finding out it would not have a Scottish precedent to follow in the region's quest for independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While noting he would have preferred a yes vote in the Scottish referendum, the Catalan President, Artur Mas, said the task of independence would now be left to Catalonia: &amp;quot;Maybe the first case will be the Catalan one.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/19/catalonia-parliament-independence-referendum-vote"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Sierra Leone begins three-day shutdown to contain Ebola outbreak</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/19/sierra-leone-three-day-shutdown-ebola-outbreak</link>
      <description>Six million confined to their homes with only essential workers exempt, while volunteers go door to door handing out soap&lt;p&gt;Some 6 million residents in Sierra Leone hunkered down at home on Friday as the country began a three-day lockdown aimed at raising awareness about the deadly Ebola virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The normally crowded streets were empty in the hilly capital, Freetown, with only security officials and essential workers with government passes allowed out. &amp;quot;Freetown is looking very lonely. We are all just staying at home waiting,&amp;quot; said taxi driver Salifu Conte.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/19/sierra-leone-three-day-shutdown-ebola-outbreak"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Baltic states wary as Russia takes more strident tone with neighbours</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/18/baltic-states-wary-russia-strident-estonia-latvia-lithuania-nato</link>
      <description>Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, anxious that battle of wits with Kremlin may escalate, look to Nato for back-up pledge&lt;p&gt;The 23rd floor of the Hotel Viru in Tallinn has been carefully preserved as a reminder of Estonia's past. Like much else in the Soviet era, it did not officially exist even though everyone knew it was there. It was where the KGB sat every day and night to eavesdrop on the conversations of the hotel's mostly foreign guests. It remains today as it was when the Soviet spies hastily evacuated at Estonian independence 23 years ago, leaving their listening equipment behind them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tone of the guide is jaunty, joking that guests found it quicker to get the minibar replenished by talking loudly to the table lamp than by calling room service. The clunky equipment and cold war paranoia all seems absurd and dated now, but although the KGB fled the Viru, it never altogether left Estonia. Its successor, the Federal Security Bureau (FSB), has remained highly active in Estonia and its Baltic neighbours, Latvia and Lithuania  increasingly so recently as Russia seeks to reassert its sway over what it calls the &amp;quot;near abroad&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/18/baltic-states-wary-russia-strident-estonia-latvia-lithuania-nato"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>European fruit growers bruised by Russian sanctions</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/18/fruit-growers-russian-sanctions-vegetables</link>
      <description>Moscow's tit-for-tat ban on imports of fruits and vegetables over Ukraine crisis leaves EU producers facing bleak autumn&lt;p&gt;When Russia banned imports of Polish apples in July, politicians and the public laughed off the move by posing with the forbidden fruit on Twitter. Everyone from the head of the national security bureau to TV presenters posted gleeful photos, making the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/31/poland-takes-bite-out-russian-apple-ban" title=""&gt;&amp;quot;Eat apples to annoy Putin&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; campaign a social media hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six weeks later, after the Kremlin extended its ban to all European fresh produce, from Greek peaches to German gherkins and Lithuanian cauliflowers, eating apples as a political statement is wearing thin. &amp;quot;In the beginning there was a slight growth in consumption, but now it has gone back to normal,&amp;quot; says Jolanta Kazimierska, head of the Polish Fruit Union.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/18/fruit-growers-russian-sanctions-vegetables"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>China to invest billions in railways, industrial parks and perhaps nuclear power, but experts say amount is less than expected&lt;p&gt;India and China have announced a series of deals aimed at boosting economic growth in both countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, said on a visit to Delhi that China would invest billions of dollars over the next five years in railways, industrial parks and, potentially, nuclear power in India.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/18/india-china-trade-deals-xi-delhi"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Russia, Ukraine and Europe have been into Vladimir Putin's black hole of fear</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/18/russia-ukraine-europe-putin-black-hole</link>
      <description>The formula for saving any dictatorship is universal: create an enemy, start a war. We are back in Soviet times of total lies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/18/russia-ukraine-europe-vladimir-putin" title=""&gt; -&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember that as a child I read about black holes in a popular science magazine about space and it scared me. The idea of our world being sucked into these breaks in the universe kept bothering me until I realised that it all was so far away that it would not reach us. But then a black hole tore our world very close to us. It started sucking in houses, roads, cars, planes, people and whole countries. Russia and Ukraine have already fallen into this black hole. And it is now sucking in Europe in front of our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hole in the universe is the soul of one very lonely ageing man. The black hole is his fear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/18/russia-ukraine-europe-putin-black-hole"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
