The special election for one of five alderman seats in Poplarville, with a population of about 2,800, ended in a 177-177 tie after one voter who showed up on Tuesday without photo ID, which is required under state law, later produced identification, said Glenn Bolin, one of the candidates. Bolin and his opponent, Stephanie Bounds, a nurse, were not told which candidate the key voter supported, he said. "Now we've got to do what the law says as far as settling this." The tie-breaker, to be overseen by the local election commission, is set to take place Thursday evening, Poplarville Mayor Brad Necaise said.</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/mississippi-election-winner-chosen-random-tied-race-193717700.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2014 15:55:50 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">mississippi-election-winner-chosen-random-tied-race-193717700</guid></item><item><title>Indicted S.C.
