      <title>Obama's great dilemma: to be or not to be the world's policeman | Michael Cohen</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/13/obama-american-foreign-policy-isis-iraq</link>
      <description>The president's willingness to lead the fight against Isis doesn't tally with his talk of curbing America's role on the world stage&lt;p&gt;Iraq America just can't quit you. For 23 years and across four presidencies, American planes have been waging war either against or on behalf of Iraqis. And if &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/sep/10/obama-speech-strategy-destroy-isis-iraq-syria" title=""&gt;President Obama's &lt;/a&gt;prediction of a long-term struggle against Isis is correct, it might soon be five presidents and a quarter of a century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does that keep happening? How did a candidate who won the nation's highest office on a platform of ending the war in Iraq find himself six years later announcing yet another military engagement in Iraq? How has a president who has seemingly made it his priority to pivot to Asia, rely less on the military and put forward a more restrained foreign policy been thwarted once again?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/13/obama-american-foreign-policy-isis-iraq"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Indian city of Surat anticipates worst effects of climate change</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/15/indian-cities-climate-change-surat</link>
      <description>Gujarat city on Indias west coast is preparing to cope with twin disasters brought on by rapid growth and global warming&lt;p&gt;According to the climate change experts, it is only a matter of time. The city of Surat (population 4.5 million), in the state of Gujarat on the west coast of India, will soon be exposed to recurrent flooding, with the risk of malaria and dengue fever epidemics in its aftermath. It also faces higher temperatures, which may force companies to relocate. So its citizens are planning for twin disasters that rapid urban development and global warming bring in their wake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2008 Surat, which owes its success to the textile, diamond and petrochemical industries, was one of the pioneer members of the &lt;a href="http://www.acccrn.org/" title=""&gt;Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network&lt;/a&gt; (Acccrn) set up by the &lt;a href="http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/" title=""&gt;Rockefeller Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. It now receives technical and financial assistance to identify threats and test solutions. Cities are where the interplay of climate risk and poverty lead to the direst consequences, the Foundation warns on its website.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/15/indian-cities-climate-change-surat"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>McDonalds to trademark 'McBrunch' for a bigger bite of the breakfast market</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/16/mcdonalds-mcbrunch-trademark-breakfast-food</link>
      <description>One-quarter of the companys revenues come from morning customers, a percentage it wants to increase&lt;p&gt;In the latest sign that McDonalds is trying to consolidate its control of the coveted breakfast market, the fast food chain has applied to trademark a new word that could appeal to late morning risers everywhere: McBrunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The application, which the maker of the Egg McMuffin filed on 23 July, signals at the very least an interest in expanding what has been one of the companys fastest-growing and most profitable day segments. Weve been serving breakfast now for over 30 years and it is one of our strongest day parts, Peter Benson, McDonalds CFO, said in a company earnings call this spring. From a profitability perspective, [breakfast is] the strongest. And so well continue to focus on our breakfast opportunities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/16/mcdonalds-mcbrunch-trademark-breakfast-food"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Inside the 19 September edition</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/sep/16/inside-the-19-september-edition</link>
      <description>The worlds policeman returns; South African justice on trial; Sweden jumps to the left&lt;p&gt;In the UK this week, one topic has dominated conversation in pubs, offices and living rooms up and down the country. After 307 years of union, will Scotland opt to stay in the UK or go its own way? Regrettably, the outcome of Thursdays referendum was not known before this weeks paper went to press, so make the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk" title=""&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; your first call for live news and reaction as the Scots go to the polls (the result is expected around &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/scottish-independence-blog/2014/sep/15/scottish-independence-when-will-the-referendum-result-be-announced" title=""&gt;7am Friday morning in the UK&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On our cover we focus on another story with far-reaching global ramifications: President Barack Obamas decision to authorise US military action in Iraq against the jihadists of Islamic State. Its a significant moment, contradicting one of Obamas key stated aims on reaching office six years ago. Has the US stepped back into the role of global policeman? Guardian US columnist &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-cohen" title=""&gt;Michael Cohen&lt;/a&gt; takes the president to task in a perceptive piece of commentary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/sep/16/inside-the-19-september-edition"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Good to meet you ... Jean-Marie Gillis</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/sep/09/good-to-meet-you-jean-marie-gillis</link>
      <description>A native French speaker develops a love of the English language through reading the Guardian Weekly&lt;p&gt;As a young Belgian scientist, I was trained in a research laboratory in London. I moved there with my family and every weekend we discovered the countryside. Back in Belgium, I developed a nostalgia for the UK and was in search of a way to keep in touch. A colleague of mine, who had the same experience a few years before, recommended I&amp;nbsp;get a subscription to the Guardian Weekly. It was around 1975. I was hooked, and I still am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I appreciate that the Weekly provides both information and reflection, the latter being the most important for me. Very often, what I read makes me weigh and consider, and even challenge my preconceived ideas. The Weekly Review is a good example of this. I am a Roman Catholic and church attendant, and I find often severe criticism of the Catholic church in reading the Weekly. Far from upsetting me, this has a stimulating effect towards producing a more critical attitude.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/sep/09/good-to-meet-you-jean-marie-gillis"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Yorkshire win first county cricket championship in 13 years</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/16/weekly-sport-diary-yorkshire-cricket</link>
      <description>Alberto Contador takes Vuelta a España; rivalry ahead of Ryder Cup; Floyd Mayweather outpoints Marcos Maidana&lt;p&gt;Joyous scenes and even the odd purchase of a round in the pub were witnessed in Yorkshire as its cricketers &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/12/yorkshire-win-county-championship-nottinghamshire" title=""&gt;won the English county championship&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since 2001. A thumping victory over Nottinghamshire sealed the pennant and was a triumph for coach Jason Gillespie, whose three seasons at Headingley have also seen Yorkshire promoted from the second division and finish runners-up last season. This is right up there for me, said the former Australia fast bowler, whose success can surely not have passed the Australian Cricket Board by. Things were less sunny for Pakistani spinner Saeed Ajmal, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/09/icc-suspends-saeed-ajmal-bowling-action" title=""&gt;suspended by the ICB for an illegal bowling action&lt;/a&gt;, and the former New Zealand all-rounder Chris Cairns, who is to &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/12/former-cricketer-chris-cairns-confirms-he-will-face-perjury-charges" title=""&gt;face perjury charges&lt;/a&gt; in the UK linked to a successful libel action he brought in 2012 over match-fixing allegations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/16/weekly-sport-diary-yorkshire-cricket"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>A reader celebrates enjoying the Weekly for more than a half-century, along with her husband of 50 years&lt;p&gt;The catalyst for our long association with the Guardian was attendance at the University of Wales from 1961 to 1965, and access to free print in the common rooms and libraries. Our conclusion was that the daily Manchester Guardian was the best and as a consequence on arrival in Canada in 1968 we bought the Weekly as often as we could. We took out a subscription and we certainly remember the airmail-quality paper and sending our subscription to 164 Deansgate, Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This began a connection with the Guardian organisation that has lasted longer than the 50 years of marriage that Martin and I celebrate this year. We are still being informed through the progressive lens that the Guardian always provides.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/sep/16/good-to-meet-you-angela-wooldridge"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Guardian Weekly Letters, 19 September 2014</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/sep/16/guardian-weekly-letters-intervention-limits</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The limits of intervention; growth is no panacea; the wonder of books&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is US foreign policy principled realism or failed isolationism? writes Dan Roberts &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/29/obama-us-foreign-policy-isis-syria-iraq-ukraine" title=""&gt;(5 September)&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, this debate has merit: many argue that Obama has used hard power too much, such as with his drone programme, resulting in many innocent deaths. Others argue he is too soft, on Vladimir Putin and others, resulting on lines being crossed. It seems Obama cant win, as he is criticised heavily either way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/sep/16/guardian-weekly-letters-intervention-limits"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Israeli refuseniks will be treated as criminals, says defence minister</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/15/israeli-refuseniks-are-criminals-defence-minister</link>
      <description>Moshe Ya'alon joins political and military leadership in attack on reservists who refuse to serve in Palestinian territories&lt;p&gt;Forty-three Israeli &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/12/israeli-intelligence-reservists-refuse-serve-palestinian-territories" title=""&gt;military intelligence reservists&lt;/a&gt; who signed a letter refusing to serve in the occupied Palestinian territories have been denounced as criminal by defence minister Moshe Ya'alon, as the country's political and military leadership turned its fire on the refuseniks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ferocity of the response was not unexpected by those involved. One signatory told the Guardian before publication that he feared being portrayed as an enemy of the state after the letter was made public.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/15/israeli-refuseniks-are-criminals-defence-minister"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Bit Butterfly Count shows species that has lost three-quarters of its population since 1970s increasing numbers by more than fifth&lt;p&gt;The coldest August for 20 years was not enough to halt the mysterious &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/03/butterflywatch-high-hopes-small-tortoiseshell"&gt;revival of the small tortoiseshell butterfly&lt;/a&gt; which had been in apparently terminal decline in recent decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The much-loved garden favourite adorned buddleia bushes across the land as numbers rose by a quarter compared to last summer, according to the &lt;a href="http://www.bigbutterflycount.org/"&gt;Big Butterfly Count&lt;/a&gt;, the largest annual insect survey in the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/15/tortoiseshell-butterfly-fights-back-big-butterfly-count"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/14/isis-beheading-videos-testing-west-resolve</link>
      <description>Experts believe slickly produced footage of murders is meant to show that resistance is useless and to warn off enemies&lt;p&gt;The formula has been identical: three condemned men discussing their imminent deaths with unnerving composure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the beheading videos that have horrified Britain and the US, James Foley, Steven Sotloff and David Haines have calmly stuck to their scripts, while their killer stands waiting behind them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/14/isis-beheading-videos-testing-west-resolve"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Spanish government set to abandon plan to limit abortion access</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/14/spanish-government-abandons-tough-abortion-law</link>
      <description>Conservative People's party planned to enact some of the toughest abortion laws in Europe, but changes proved unpopular&lt;p&gt;The Spanish government is poised to abandon its plans to drastically limit access to abortion in the country, according to the newspaper El Mundo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conservative People's party introduced legislation in December that would &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/18/spain-reform-abortion-fury" title=""&gt;make abortion illegal except in the case of rape&lt;/a&gt; or when there is a risk to the physical and mental health of the mother. The legislation sought to enact some of the toughest abortion laws in Europe, requiring women wanting an abortion to have two doctors verify that these conditions had been met.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/14/spanish-government-abandons-tough-abortion-law"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Taliban sneak back into Kandahar, dressed as grape farmers</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/14/taliban-back-in-kandahar-400-people-die-august-fighting</link>
      <description>Around 400 people die in August after two weeks of fighting as many blame Afghan election gridlock for aiding the insurgency&lt;p&gt;The men were dressed as migrant workers. Over the course of two or three days, as many as 600 of them made their way through the checkpoints dotted around the southern Afghanistan province of Kandahar. Many of them hauled trolleys carrying crates of freshly picked grapes as they headed towards the outlying district of Zheri, some 24 miles (38km) west of Kandahar city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the men shared idle banter with the police officers, speaking laconically of this year's grape harvest in neighbouring districts. The police officers let them pass; if they had looked more carefully they may have spotted the guns and ammunition hidden under the shipments of grapes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/14/taliban-back-in-kandahar-400-people-die-august-fighting"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Measures include a points system to punish repeat offenders and stiffer penalties for speeding and failure to stop at red lights&lt;p&gt;For decades, the chaotic mel&amp;eacute;e on India's roads has been held up as a point of pride by locals who argued that, though unnerving, the free-for-all worked in a way that foreign practices such as staying in your lane or using your mirrors would not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the government of &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/narendra-modi" title=""&gt;Narendra Modi&lt;/a&gt;, who won a landslide victory in May, hopes to tame the rickshaws, elephants, trucks, luxury SUVs, bicycles, camels, five-seater motorbikes, cows and buses that battle it out each day on the country's highways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/14/modi-law-india-traffic-roads"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>In Vietnam, thieves cash in on growing emotional value of pet dogs</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/13/vietnam-dogs-thieves-ransom-pets</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Burgeoning desire for pedigree breeds creates a lucrative market for criminals who steal pets for resale or ransom&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the golden light of a late Sunday afternoon, around a dozen people gather with their pet dogs at a small park near a lotus pond in Hanois affluent Tay Ho district. The mood is convivial but theres one topic that puts people on edge  dog thieves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I was watching the final of the World Cup, our dog was robbed from the yard of the house, says 40-year-old Hai, who sits in the park with his daughter and a two-month-old doberman puppy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/13/vietnam-dogs-thieves-ransom-pets"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/12/weekly-sport-diary-germany-scotland</link>
      <description>Lee Westwood given Ryder Cup berth; England win T20 after India take one-day series; Lewis Hamilton wins Italian Grand Prix&lt;p&gt;The corporate padded seating from Julys World Cup final may have only just cooled, but new champions Germany were back to the more humdrum business of European Championship qualifying with a &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/07/germany-scotland-euro-2016-group-d-report" title=""&gt;2-1 win over Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. In Tbilisi, a spectacular late goal from Aiden McGeady gave the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2014/sep/07/georgia-v-republic-of-ireland-euro-2016-qualifier-live" title=""&gt;Republic of Ireland a 2-1 victory over Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, but that achievement was eclipsed by &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/07/hungary-northern-ireland-euro-2016-group-f-report" title=""&gt;Northern Ireland, who beat Hungary 2-1&lt;/a&gt; with an 88th-minute winner from Kyle Lafferty to record their first away win in four years. Elsewhere, a Danny Welbeck double gave &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/08/switzerland-england-european-championship-qualifier" title=""&gt;England a 2-0 win&lt;/a&gt; in Switzerland, Portugal slumped to a 1-0 home defeat by Albania and Gibraltars first foray into the world of international qualifying ended with a 7-0 home thumping by Poland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/12/weekly-sport-diary-germany-scotland"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Luxury resort where pampered pets get a five-star service</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/12/animal-hotel-pampered-pet-cat-dog</link>
      <description>From Pawlates to chicken nuggets, nothing is too much trouble for cosseted cats and dogs&lt;p&gt;Hotel manager Dixie Eng stops by a room to check on an overnight guest. Classical music plays while guests sleep. Some have brought blankets and toys, reminders of home. Signs on each door give a hint of the personalities within: separation anxiety, escape artist, poo eater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lets see how you did, Eng says, looking around the room. You peed, you pooped. Good job, Ollie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/12/animal-hotel-pampered-pet-cat-dog"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The journalists who never sleep</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/12/artificial-intelligence-data-journalism-media</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Robot writers that can interpret data and generate stories are starting to appear in certain business and media sectors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At dawn on 17 March the inhabitants of Los Angeles were woken by a mild tremor. Less than three minutes later the Los Angeles Times website &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/earthquake-27-quake-strikes-near-westwood-california-rdivor-story.html#ixzz2wEWmfUmX" title=""&gt;published an initial piece on the subject&lt;/a&gt;, at first sight a wire drafted in haste by a press agency: A shallow magnitude 4.7 earthquake was reported Monday morning five miles [8km] from Westwood, California, according to the US Geological Survey. The temblor occurred at 6.25am Pacific time at a depth of 5.0 miles. According to the USGS, the epicentre was six miles from Beverly Hills, California, seven miles from Universal City, California, seven miles from Santa Monica, California, and 348 miles from Sacramento, California. In the past 10 days, there have been no earthquakes magnitude 3.0 and greater centred nearby. This information comes from the USGS Earthquake Notification Service and this post was created by an algorithm written by the author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author in question is on the staff of the Times, doubling up as a journalist and computer programmer. That morning the USGS servers received data from various seismographs, translated them into figures and sent them over the net to the journalists personal computer. Once there the data were imported by software, which selected the relevant information and drafted an article in everyday English. The journalist, who had woken with a jolt, got up, read the article and clicked send, but in fact this sort of text could be published without any human intervention. Next time even if he stays in bed, Times readers will receive the news.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/12/artificial-intelligence-data-journalism-media"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
