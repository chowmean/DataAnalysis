      <title>This Islamic State nightmare is not a holy war but an unholy mess | Jonathan Freedland</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/08/islamic-state-nightmare-not-holy-unholy-mess-iraq</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It isnt religious zeal but the collapse of state power that makes the clash in Iraq feel like a return to the dark ages&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/08/us-begins-air-strikes-iraq-isis"&gt;US begins air strikes against Isis targets in Iraq, Pentagon says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a voice pleading and in despair, the woman who had fled for her life asked: What century are we&amp;nbsp;in? She was an Iraqi Christian, reached by the BBC World Service even as she sought to escape the self-declared Islamic State, or IS (formerly Isis). They will sell us, she said. They will rape us. Her words echoed this weeks &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdIEm1s6yhY&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be" title=""&gt;tearful warning to the Iraqi parliament from a Kurdish MP&lt;/a&gt; who described the fate befalling her fellow Yazidis. Mr Speaker, our women are being taken as slaves and sold in the slave market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The year is 2014 and yet 40,000 followers of a 1,000-year-old faith are huddling &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/07/40000-iraqis-stranded-mountain-isis-death-threat" title=""&gt;on a mountainside said to be the final resting place of Noahs Ark&lt;/a&gt;, fearing their women are to be dragged to a slave market. As the woman asked, what century are we in?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/08/islamic-state-nightmare-not-holy-unholy-mess-iraq"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Shinzo Abe looks for allies outside Japan as popularity wanes at home</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/11/shinzo-abe-japan-popularity-decline</link>
      <description>Japanese PMs approval ratings drop following Abenomics finance strategy and reinterpretation of pacifist defence policy&lt;p&gt;Japans prime minister Shinzo Abe showed off his football skills in Brasilia earlier this month, kicking a ball around with Zico, the Brazilian who once coached the Japanese team. The premier also had a friendly meeting with Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and signed some energy deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he was in Mexico the week before, Abe and his wife, Akie, visited the ancient ruins in Teotihuacan, where they took photos alongside Mexican President Enrique Pe&amp;ntilde;a Nieto and his wife, Angelica Rivera. Later, Pe&amp;ntilde;a Nieto praised Abes bold transformations of the Japanese economy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/11/shinzo-abe-japan-popularity-decline"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/aug/12/inside-guardian-weekly-abby-deveney</link>
      <description>In Iraq, a war on weakness; Japans Abe looks for new friends abroad; how big data will belittle democracy&lt;p&gt;Its difficult diving back in after a couple of weeks away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guardian executive editor and comment chief &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathanfreedland" title=""&gt;Jonathan Freedland&lt;/a&gt; made it easier, with a super piece of thoughtful writing about geopolitics in Iraq. Is this a new holy war? Freedland poses and probes this question, arguing that power grabs by the Islamic State jihadist movement are more about power than religion. You will find his piece on our front page.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/aug/12/inside-guardian-weekly-abby-deveney"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Good to meet you ... Christine Asmar</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/aug/12/weekly-good-to-meet-you-christine-asmar</link>
      <description>This reader appreciates how the Weekly makes sense of the senseless and shows compassion to the victims of injustice&lt;p&gt;In the heady days of 1970s London, discovering the Guardian was just one of many excitements for a young Australian ex-convent girl. To parental horror, I soon married a Palestinian and set off for the Arabian Gulf. In Dubai, and thereafter Kuwait, Qatar and Riyadh, the Guardian Weeklys arrival was precious. The thin airmail paper meant I could fold it up into small handbags  very handy under an abaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You helped to make sense of senseless wars: dissecting the causes, comforting with your compassion for the victims. You recognised an entity called Palestine long before other media did, and you steadfastly report on the injustices of the occupation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/aug/12/weekly-good-to-meet-you-christine-asmar"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Hong Kongs Iron Lady takes up democracy fight with Beijing</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/anson-chan-hong-kong-women-politics</link>
      <description>Anson Chan remains one of the most influential political figures in Hong Kong. She talks about her assessment of the fight with China for democratic rights and her vision for the future&lt;p&gt;She is often called the Iron Lady of Hong Kong. Anson Chan earned respect serving as Hong Kongs second-highest official when the British were in charge. And when the colony was handed back to China in 1997, Beijing enlisted Chan to help with that transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she no longer holds any official government position, Chan, 74, remains one of the most influential political figures in Hong Kong and has re-emerged in the spotlight amid a &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/02/hong-kong-police-detain-hundreds-protest" title=""&gt;growing fight by Hong Kongers for democratic rights&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/anson-chan-hong-kong-women-politics"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>According to a new study, experiencing joy when you least expect it is the greatest boost to wellbeing&lt;p&gt;Do you remember the last time you were dreading something, only to have it turn out to be a pleasant surprise? Maybe it was a bad summer blockbuster you were forced to watch, or a blind date set up by your parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You turn up, grumbling and prepared to hate every second of it. But then, a funny thing happens: you crack a smile  laugh out loud, even  and before you know it, youre having a grand old time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/aug/16/mathematical-model-surprise-happiness-study"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Ferguson enters administration after over a century in business, with the immediate redundancy of about 70 jobs&lt;p&gt;Scotland's remaining shipbuilding industry was dealt a severe blow on Friday when the country's last commercial shipyard went into administration with the loss of about 70 jobs on the river Clyde.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After more than a century in business, staff at Ferguson Shipbuilders arrived for work at Port Glasgow, Inverclyde, in the morning to be told most of the 77-strong workforce were being made redundant with immediate effect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/aug/15/ferguson-shipbuilders-close-70-jobs-redundant"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Letter from Spain: changing coast</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/12/letter-from-spain-andalucia-seville-christopher-columbus</link>
      <description>Once the place from which Columbus sailed for the new world, the Andalusian shore has lost its mystery&lt;p&gt;I am drinking &lt;em&gt;ca&amp;ntilde;as &lt;/em&gt; glasses of beer  at my friend Pacos holiday home in Mazag&amp;oacute;n, on the Atlantic coast of Andaluc&amp;iacute;a. He is telling me about a childhood holiday that still lives in his heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was more than 50 years ago, when his father, a brigadier general, and the family were based in Seville. There were few roads then south of Seville; getting to the coast was an odyssey itself. First we drove in cars to the end of the tarmac road, Paco reminisces, then we continued in vans with special tyres that could drive on sand. After this it was tractors and trailers. Finally, mules to cross the desert dunes of the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/27/spanish-wildlife-park-under-threat" title=""&gt;Coto Do&amp;ntilde;ana&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/12/letter-from-spain-andalucia-seville-christopher-columbus"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/aug/12/arsenal-manchester-city-guardian-weekly-sports-diary</link>
      <description>Broad battered, India beaten in Test; form worry for Serena Williams; Womens Rugby World Cup moves into semi-finals&lt;p&gt;No sooner has the summers World Cup party finished  a party that England hung around at briefly before heading home early  than football returns. The traditional curtain raiser to the English season, the Community Shield, saw Premier League champions Manchester City take on FA Cup winners Arsenal, and it was the London side who finished happier after goals from Santi Cazorla, Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/10/arsenal-manchester-city-community-shield" title=""&gt;secured a 3-0 win&lt;/a&gt;. City coach Manuel Pellegrini no doubt hoped his team, though missing its key players, would have provided a stiffer test than such a blancmange of a performance, given the depth of the squad, owing to the depth of the pockets of the clubs owners. Meanwhile, Arsenals finances will be boosted if they can overcome Turkeys Besiktas for a place in the Champions League.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/aug/12/arsenal-manchester-city-guardian-weekly-sports-diary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Current outbreak in Africa has killed nearly 1,000 people, prompting an international health emergency to be declared&lt;p&gt;An experimental vaccine against the deadly Ebola virus will soon go into clinical trial, according to the British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline, which is developing it with scientists at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no proven cure or vaccine against Ebola and the scale of the current outbreak, which has already killed nearly 1,000 people, has prompted the World Health Organisation to declare an international health emergency.

      <description>Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah strike political accord many hope puts faltering deal in election dispute back on track&lt;p&gt;The two candidates in Afghanistan's disputed presidential election have reached a political agreement that would outline the terms of a power-sharing deal, both camps said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We are putting the past behind us. We are looking into the future,&amp;quot; said Ghani Ashraf, one of the candidates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/08/afghanistan-presidential-kerry-kabul-ghani-abdullah-election-dispute"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Students offered a second chance by education initiative at elite Paris school</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/08/france-education-partnership-paris-school</link>
      <description>Partnership between Lycée Buffon and non-profit organisation provides an opportunity to build confidence and find employment&lt;p&gt;This group of kids are the sort who appear to take nothing away from school  except perhaps a hatred of education. Growing up in a troubled neighbourhood in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15th_arrondissement_of_Paris" title=""&gt;Pariss 15th arrondissement&lt;/a&gt;, they had left school without diplomas or qualifications. They felt they were good for nothing and were highly distrustful of the Education Nationale, the French education system. Yet here they were at the &lt;a href="http://lyc-buffon.scola.ac-paris.fr/" title=""&gt;Lyc&amp;eacute;e Buffon&lt;/a&gt;, housed in a grand late 19th-century complex of buildings in the same district, rubbing shoulders with 2,000 middle-class Parisian youngsters, very much the sort of students they would have sneered at as swots not so long ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of bringing these kids into a prestigious high school was the brainchild of a non-profit organisation, &lt;a href="http://www.impulsion75.fr/" title=""&gt;Impulsion 75&lt;/a&gt;, which tries to give a second chance to young people aged between 15-25 who are stuck in a rut. It seemed a crazy idea, but over the past two years the Lyc&amp;eacute;e Buffon has invited 150 young people, including some who have had a brush with the law, to take part in a preparatory programme for employment and the future, an alternative to the prestigious preparatory classes for the French grandes &amp;eacute;coles, which take place in the same school complex. Moreover the bow-tie-sporting headmaster and the tracksuit-clad organisation head agree: it benefits the kids at the top of the class as much as those at the bottom. The headmaster is now honorary president of Impulsion 75.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/08/france-education-partnership-paris-school"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Cancer Drugs Fund seems to help pharmaceuticals giant Roche most</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/08/pharmaceutical-roche-benefits-cancer-drug-fund-nice-rejects-kadcyla</link>
      <description>As Nice rejects breast cancer drug Kadcyla over cost, how Swiss firm has benefited from fund it played key role in establishing&lt;p&gt;Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical company at the centre of the row over cancer drugs pricing, played a significant part in the genesis of the Cancer Drugs Fund, set up in 2010 to pay for drugs that were too expensive for NHS approval. Four years on the company has become the fund's largest beneficiary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The existence of the fund leads to some confusing results. Kadcyla, the &amp;pound;90,000 advanced breast cancer drug, was rejected on Friday by Nice, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, on cost grounds for general NHS use. But Roche is already being reimbursed from the &amp;pound;600m fund.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/08/pharmaceutical-roche-benefits-cancer-drug-fund-nice-rejects-kadcyla"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
