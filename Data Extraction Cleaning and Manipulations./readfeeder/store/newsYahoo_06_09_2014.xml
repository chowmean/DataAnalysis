"I expect the Department of Corrections to implement the proposed improvements in protocols to ensure that future executions are performed effectively," Governor Mary Fallin said, adding that the

He however strongly denied the claims that Gaziantep province hosted a camp of IS militants after some pictures purporting to show such a facility circulated in media outlets last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"/&gt;</media:text><media:credit role="publishing company"></media:credit></item><item><title>Tape of Okla. running back punching woman shown to media</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/ncaaf-dr-saturday/tape-of-suspended-ou-rb-joe-mixon-punching-woman-shown-to-media-183849393.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/HtgqEJ83_kgIkjT7FPMVeg--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/sports/2014-02-28/d48ad3f0-a051-11e3-8aeb-b5427b31fc45_2014-Joe-Mixon.jpg" width="130" height="86" alt="" align="left" title="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Norman, Okla., police arranged a viewing of surveillance tape of an incident involving suspended Oklahoma RB Joe Mixon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"/&gt;</description><link>http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/ncaaf-dr-saturday/tape-of-suspended-ou-rb-joe-mixon-punching-woman-shown-to-media-183849393.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 1969 19:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">blogs/ncaaf-dr-saturday/tape-of-suspended-ou-rb-joe-mixon-punching-woman-shown-to-media-183849393</guid><media:content url="http://l1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/HtgqEJ83_kgIkjT7FPMVeg--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/sports/2014-02-28/d48ad3f0-a051-11e3-8aeb-b5427b31fc45_2014-Joe-Mixon.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="130" height="86"></media:content><media:text type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/ncaaf-dr-saturday/tape-of-suspended-ou-rb-joe-mixon-punching-woman-shown-to-media-183849393.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/HtgqEJ83_kgIkjT7FPMVeg--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/sports/2014-02-28/d48ad3f0-a051-11e3-8aeb-b5427b31fc45_2014-Joe-Mixon.jpg" width="130" height="86" alt="" align="left" title="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Norman, Okla., police arranged a viewing of surveillance tape of an incident involving suspended Oklahoma RB Joe Mixon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"/&gt;</media:text><media:credit role="publishing company"></media:credit></item><item><title>Giant live millipedes seized at San Francisco airport</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/millipedes-seized-sf-airport-164406131.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/WmgcBUoELK1KiDbAzCHTZw--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/news/2014-09-04/1e26e440-3454-11e4-89d6-b1a6f12692f6_Giant-Millipedes.jpg" width="130" height="86" alt="Giant millipedes" align="left" title="Giant millipedes" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Customs agents say they have seized 20 live giant millipedes hidden inside a box marked &amp;quot;toy car model&amp;quot; that arrived at the mail facility at San Francisco International Airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"/&gt;</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/millipedes-seized-sf-airport-164406131.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2014 12:44:09 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">millipedes-seized-sf-airport-164406131</guid><media:content url="http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/WmgcBUoELK1KiDbAzCHTZw--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/news/2014-09-04/1e26e440-3454-11e4-89d6-b1a6f12692f6_Giant-Millipedes.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="130" height="86"></media:content><media:text type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/millipedes-seized-sf-airport-164406131.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/WmgcBUoELK1KiDbAzCHTZw--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/news/2014-09-04/1e26e440-3454-11e4-89d6-b1a6f12692f6_Giant-Millipedes.jpg" width="130" height="86" alt="Giant millipedes" align="left" title="Giant millipedes" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Customs agents say they have seized 20 live giant millipedes hidden inside a box marked &amp;quot;toy car model&amp;quot; that arrived at the mail facility at San Francisco International Airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"/&gt;</media:text><media:credit role="publishing company"></media:credit></item><item><title>Rivers wanted paparazzi, Meryl Streep at her funeral</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://celebrity.yahoo.com/news/joan-rivers-wanted-paparazzi-meryl-streep-her-showbiz-205000637-us-weekly.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/vmD6LdYRCAJOq9FU5CdoiQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-us/homerun/tvguide.cbs.com/ea79488368c25f1c165cfb295b2c59f4" width="130" height="86" alt="" align="left" title="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Even when speaking about death, Joan Rivers was hilarious, wise, and inimitable.
