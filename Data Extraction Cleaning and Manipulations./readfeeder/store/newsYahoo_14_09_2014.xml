The so-called Silverado Fire, which broke out in the Cleveland National Forest on Friday morning, had charred some 1,600 acres (647 hectares) by Saturday afternoon as it burned through brush and chaparral left bone dry by California's record drought. The heat wave that has sent temperatures soaring over 100 Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) in parts of Southern California on Saturday and was not expected to break until late Sunday. The sweltering heat prompted Los Angeles health officials to issue a "heat alert" for this weekend, urging residents to take special precautions. "Extreme heat such as this is not just an inconvenience, it can be dangerous and even deadly, but we can protect ourselves, our families and our neighbors if we take steps to remain cool and hydrated," Dr. Jeffrey Gunzenhauser, the city's interim health director, said in issuing the heat alert.</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/crews-battle-control-wildfire-southern-california-bakes-213845068.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2014 17:38:45 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">crews-battle-control-wildfire-southern-california-bakes-213845068</guid></item><item><title>Miss America to be crowned Sunday in stressed Atlantic City, N.J.</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/miss-america-crowned-sunday-stressed-atlantic-city-n-201839699.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/n6EqezvOgHkViVoZWOZk1Q--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2014-09-13T202453Z_2_LYNXMPEA8C0CF_RTROPTP_2_USA-MISSAMERICA.JPG" width="130" height="86" alt="Contestants sport swimsuits during the second preliminary night of the 2015 Miss America Competition in Atlantic City, New Jersey" align="left" title="Contestants sport swimsuits during the second preliminary night of the 2015 Miss America Competition in Atlantic City, New Jersey" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;By Sean Landis Sept 13 (Reuters) - The winner of the 2015 Miss America Pageant will be crowned on Sunday night in Atlantic City, and the wearer&amp;#039;s glittering tiara will stand in contrast to the tarnished fortunes of this New Jersey beach town where yet another casino is slated to close this week.
